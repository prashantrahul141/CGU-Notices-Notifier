    "Hello! My only purpose is to send you notifications whenever CGU posts any updates on their \
                  website's notice board.\nSince it doesn\'t have a system where it can notify students on updates,\
                   it creates quite a lot of confusion among the students.\nI stand to solve that problem by notifying everyone who is \
                   subscribed to me within 10 minutes.\nYou can subscribe too, just by sending a /subscribe to me. \
                   And you can unsubscibe from me anytime you want!\n\n \
